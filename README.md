This project focuses on delivering business intelligence solutions through an executive-grade Power BI dashboard analyzing the sales, customer, and regional performance of a global bike retailer.  
The primary goal was to uncover actionable insights that drive business strategy â€” including revenue optimization, market expansion, product portfolio management, and customer loyalty growth â€” by transforming fragmented raw data into structured, decision-ready analytics.

## Project Objectives
- Build a dynamic, real-time dashboard enabling executives to monitor KPIs and identify emerging trends proactively.
- Integrate and model fragmented sales, customer, and geography datasets into a coherent star schema structure.
- Perform deep exploratory data analysis (EDA) to surface strategic business opportunities and risks.
- Enable non-technical stakeholders to independently explore insights via self-service analytics.
